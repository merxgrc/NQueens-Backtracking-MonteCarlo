# NQueens-Backtracking-Montecarlo
This is a Java implementation of the N-Queens problem solver using a backtracking algorithm I learned in my Analysis of algorithms class. A Monte Carlo algorithm I learned about in the same class was used to estimate the efficiency of the backtracking solution by calculating the average number of nodes visited during multiple test runs.
